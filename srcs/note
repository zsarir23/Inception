Data:
	Volumes;
	Bind Mounting;

Volumes:are stored in part of the host filesystem which is managed by Docker.
	Non-Docker processes should not modify this part of the filesystem.
	Volumes ars the best way to persist data in Docker.
	a given Volume can be mounted into multiple containers simultaneously
Bind Mounting:may be stored anywhere on the host system
	Non-Docker processes on the Docker host or Docker container can modify this part of the filesystem.
	To use bind Mounts, the file or directory does not need to esist on your Docker host already. if it doesn't exist, it will be created on demand.


---------Docker networking--------------------
Bridge network :default
HOST Disables Docker's network isolation
None does not attach containers to any network.
Overlay
Macvlan

	Docker network create --drive bridge <network_name>
	Docker network create --drive bridge --subnet <subnet> <network_name>
	Docker run --network=<network_name> -d -it <container>
	docker network disconnect <network_name> <container>
	docker network connect <network_name> <container>
